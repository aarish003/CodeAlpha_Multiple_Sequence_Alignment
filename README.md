 Task Description

This task involves performing **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)** on protein sequences belonging to the same family to identify **conserved regions, functional motifs, and evolutionary relationships**.

Protein Family Selected
**Hemoglobin Beta Chain (HBB)**
A key protein involved in oxygen transport in vertebrates.

 Protein Sequences Used
Protein sequences were downloaded from **UniProt**.

| Organism                     | UniProt ID |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| Homo sapiens (Human)         | P68871     |
| Pan troglodytes (Chimpanzee) | HBB_PANTR  |
| Mus musculus (Mouse)         | P02088     |
| Rattus norvegicus (Rat)      | P02091     |
| Bos taurus (Cow)             | P02070     |

 Methodology

1. Protein sequences were collected in FASTA format from UniProt.
2. All sequences were uploaded to Clustal Omega.
3. Multiple Sequence Alignment was performed.
4. Conserved residues and alignment patterns were analyzed.
5. Screenshots and alignment files were saved for reporting.


 Results & Observations

* Strong conservation seen in functional regions.
* Minimal variation among primate species.
* Rodent sequences showed moderate divergence.
* Conserved histidine residues involved in oxygen binding were identified.


Interpretation

The conserved regions across species highlight the biological importance of the Hemoglobin Beta Chain and confirm its evolutionary stability.
